 *
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * The following diagram shows how the process to set the Email config works
 * from the user point of view.<br/><br/>
