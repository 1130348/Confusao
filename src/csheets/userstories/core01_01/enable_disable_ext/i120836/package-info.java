/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story core01_1: enable/disable
 * extensions.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
 * Provide a window to allow enable and disable cleansheets extensions. It
 * should also be a sidebar window "Navigator" to submit extensions (enable and
 * disable) .
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Enable/Disable":</b> The user selects the extension on the
 * "Navigator" tab where he can disable or enable the extension desired.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * The UC Core01.1 objective is to organize the extensions in the
 * application.<br />
 * The application will have a SideBar "Navigator" that will show the all the
 * extensions giving the chance to modify the status (enable/disable) of the
 * extension. The extension(s) that received a modify(disable) to it's status
 * will appear "locked" and if enable will allow to be used. For the development
 * of the this functionality we will use a few classes ans their properties that
 * already has been created like: "ExtensionManager" and "Extension".
 * <br/>
