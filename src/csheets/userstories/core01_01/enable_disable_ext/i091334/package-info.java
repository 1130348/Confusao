/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story core01_1: enable/disable
 * extensions.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
 * Provide a window to allow enable and disable cleansheets extensions. It
 * should also be a sidebar window "Navigator" to submit extensions (enable and
 * disable) .
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Enable/Disable":</b> The user selects the extension on the
 * "Navigator" tab where he can disable or enable the extension desired.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * User Story Core01.1 aims to organize the extensions in the application.<br />
 * The application will have a SideBar "Navigator" that will show the user all
 * the extensions and will give the possibility to change the status
 * (enable/disable) of the extension. The extensions that received an status
 * change to disabled will appear "locked" and if enable will allow the use of
 * it.r For the development of the this feature we will use some classes that
 * already exist like "ExtensionManager" and "Extension" and their properties.
 * <br/>
