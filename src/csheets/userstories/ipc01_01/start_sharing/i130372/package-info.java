/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story ipc01_01: start sharing.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
 * Allow connect to another instance of cleansheets and send a range of cells
 * for other instance. The received content should be presented in the same
 * "local". For this, in each instance cleansheets must be possible to define a
 * port for connections. It should be possible to find other cleansheets
 * instances on the same LAN. Instances should appear in a window and used to
 * make the connection. At this stage it is only necessary to transmit the
 * contents of the cells.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Start Sharing":</b>
 * The user selects the cells that he wants to share. Then begins the process of
 * connecting to another online user. The system displays a list of users to
 * which it can connect. The user selects customer that he wants to share cells
 * and the system sends the previously selected information.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * Since the connection between the users is necessary to study how the data
 * transmission protocols (TCP) and the search server protocol (UDP), and with
 * the definition of network and ports. On the other hand we must understand the
 * functioning of cells in order to submit their content to another user.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * From the previous diagram we see that we need to add a new "attribute" to a
 * cell: "comment".<br/>
 * Therefore, at this point, we need to study how to add this new attribute to
 * the class/interface "cell". This is the core technical problem regarding this
 * issue.<br/>
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * We can see a class diagram of the domain model of the application
 * <a href="../../../../overview-summary.html#modelo_de_dominio">here</a><br/>
 * From the domain model we see that there is a Cell interface. This defines the
 * interface of the cells. We also see that there is a class CellImpl that must
 * implement the Cell interface.<br/>
 * If we open the {@link csheets.core.Cell} code we see that the interface is
 * defined as:
 * <code>public interface Cell extends Comparable &lt;Cell&gt;, Extensible&lt;Cell&gt;, Serializable</code>.
 * Because of the <code>Extensible</code> it seams that a cell can be
 * extended.<br/>
 *
 * <h2>5. Coding</h2>
 * see:<br/>
 * <a href="../../../../csheets/ext/comments/package-summary.html">csheets.ext.comments</a><br/>
 * <a href="../../../../csheets/ext/comments/ui/package-summary.html">csheets.ext.comments.ui</a><br/>
 * <br/>
 * <h2>6. Final Remarks</h2>
 * As an extra this use case also implements a small cell visual decorator if
 * the ce If we further investigate the hierarchy of {@link csheets.core.Cell}
 * we see that it has a subclass {@link csheets.ext.CellExtension} which has a
 * subclass {@link csheets.ext.style.StylableCell}.
 * {@link csheets.ext.style.StylableCell} seems to be an example of how to
 * extend cells.<br/>
 * Therefore, we will assume that it is possible to extend cells and start to
 * implement tests for this use case. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern">delegation
 * design pattern</a> is used in the cell extension mechanism of cleansheets.
 * The following class diagram depicts the relations between classes in the
 * "Cell" hierarchy.<br/>
 * <img src="doc-files/core02_01_analysis_cell_delegate.png">
 * <br/>
 *
 * One important aspect is how extensions are dynamically created and returned.
 * The <code>Extensible</code> interface has only one method,
 * <code>getExtension</code>. Any class, to be extensible, must return a
 * specific extension by its name. The default (and base) implementation for the
 * <code>Cell</code> interface, the class <code>CellImpl</code>, implements the
 * method in the following manner:<br/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 	public Cell getExtension(String name) {
 *		// Looks for an existing cell extension
 *		CellExtension extension = extensions.get(name);
 *		if (extension == null) {
 *			// Creates a new cell extension
 *			Extension x = ExtensionManager.getInstance().getExtension(name);
 *			if (x != null) {
 *				extension = x.extend(this);
 *				if (extension != null)
 *					extensions.put(name, extension);
 *			}
 *		}
 *		return extension;
 *	}
 * }
 * </pre> As we can see from the code, if we are requesting a extension that is
 * not already present in the cell, it is applied at the moment and then
 * returned. The extension class (that implements the <code>Extension</code>
 * interface) what will do is to create a new instance of its cell extension
 * class (this will be the <b>delegator</b> in the pattern). The constructor
 * receives the instance of the cell to extend (the <b>delegate</b> in the
 * pattern). For instance, <code>StylableCell</code> (the delegator) will
 * delegate to <code>CellImpl</code> all the method invocations regarding
 * methods of the <code>Cell</code> interface. Obviously, methods specific to
 * <code>StylableCell</code> must be implemented by it.<br/>
 * Therefore, to implement a cell that can have a associated comment we need to
 * implement a class similar to <code>StylableCell</code>.<br/>
 * <h2>3. Tests</h2>
 * Basically, from requirements and also analysis, we see that the core
 * functionality of this use case is to be able to add an attribute to cells to
 * be used to store a comment/text. We need to be able to set and get its
 * value.<br/>
 * Following this approach we can start by coding a unit test that uses a
 * subclass of <code>CellExtension</code> with a new attribute for user comments
 * with the corresponding method accessors (set and get). A simple test can be
 * to set this attribute with a simple string and to verify if the get method
 * returns the same string.<br/>
 * As usual, in a test driven development approach tests normally fail in the
 * beginning. The idea is that the tests will pass in the end.<br>
 * <br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.comments.CommentableCellTest</code><br/>
 *
 * <h2>4. Design</h2>
 * To realize this user story we will need to create a subclass of Extension. We
 * will also need to create a subclass of UIExtension. For the sidebar we need
 * to implement a JPanel. In the code of the extension
 * <code>csheets.ext.style</code> we can find examples that illustrate how to
 * implement these technical requirements.<br/>
 * The following diagrams illustrate core aspects of the design of the solution
 * for this use case.<br/>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> It is very important that in the final version of this technical
 * documentation the elements depicted in these design diagrams exist in the
 * code!</br>
 *
 * <h3>Extension Setup</h3>
 * The following diagram shows the setup of the "comments" extension when
 * cleansheets is run.<br/><br/>
 * <img src="doc-files/core02_01_design.png">
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h3>User Selects a Cell</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when the user selects a cell.
 * The idea is that when this happens the extension must display in the sidebar
 * the comment of that cell (if it exists).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * <br/>
 * <h3>User Updates the Comment of a Cell</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when the user updates the text
 * of the comment of the current cell. To be noticed that this diagram does not
 * depict the actual selection of a cell (that is illustrated in the previous
 * diagram).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * ll has a comment. This "feature" is not documented in this page.<br/>
