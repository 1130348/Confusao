/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story ipc01_01: start sharing.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
 * Allow connect to another instance of cleansheets and send a range of cells
 * for other instance. The received content should be presented in the same
 * "local". For this, in each instance cleansheets must be possible to define a
 * port for connections. It should be possible to find other cleansheets
 * instances on the same LAN. Instances should appear in a window and used to
 * make the connection. At this stage it is only necessary to transmit the
 * contents of the cells.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Start Sharing":</b>
 * The user selects the cells that he wants to share. Then begins the process of
 * connecting to another online user. The system displays a list of users to
 * which it can connect. The user selects customer that he wants to share cells
 * and the system sends the previously selected information.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * Since the connection between the users is necessary to study how the data
 * transmission protocols (TCP) and the search server protocol (UDP), and with
 * the definition of network and ports. On the other hand we must understand the
 * functioning of cells in order to submit their content to another user.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * From the previous diagram we see that we need to add a new "attribute" to a
 * cell: "comment".<br/>
 * Therefore, at this point, we need to study how to add this new attribute to
 * the class/interface "cell". This is the core technical problem regarding this
 * issue.<br/>
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * We can see a class diagram of the domain model of the application
 * <a href="../../../../overview-summary.html#modelo_de_dominio">here</a><br/>
 * From the domain model we see that there is a Cell interface. This defines the
 * interface of the cells. We also see that there is a class CellImpl that must
 * implement the Cell interface.<br/>
 * If we open the {@link csheets.core.Cell} code we see that the interface is
 * defined as:
 * <code>public interface Cell extends Comparable &lt;Cell&gt;, Extensible&lt;Cell&gt;, Serializable</code>.
 * Because of the <code>Extensible</code> it seams that a cell can be
 * extended.<br/>
 *
 * <h2>3. Tests</h2>
 * Basically, from requirements and also analysis, we see that the core
 * functionality of this use case is to be able communicate with other instances
 * of "CleanSheets" and send them a selected amount of cells.<br/>
 * Following this approach we can start by coding a unit test that uses the
 * class <code>Connect</code> and tests its attribute port. Furthermore we also
 * have to perform functional tests to see if the client is properly receiving
 * the information.<br/>
 * As usual, in a test driven development approach tests normally fail in the
 * beginning. The idea is that the tests will pass in the end.<br>
 * <br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.start_sharing.StartSharingTest</code><br/>
 *
 * <h2>4. Design</h2>
 * To realize this user story we will need to create a subclass of Extension. We
 * will also need to create a subclass of UIExtension. In the code of the
 * extension <code>csheets.ext.style</code> we can find examples that illustrate
 * how to implement these technical requirements.<br/>
 * The following diagrams illustrate core aspects of the design of the solution
 * for this use case.<br/>
 *
 * <h3>Extension Setup</h3>
 * The following diagram shows the setup of the "Start Sharing" extension when
 * cleansheets is run.<br/><br/>
 * <img src="doc-files/Extension_setup_ipc_01_01.png"/>
 * <br/>
 * <h3>User Select Cells And Clicks Botton To Send</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when the user select cells.
 * When the user selects the cells the object StartSharingAction has access to
 * SpreedSheatTable who knows the user selected cells. After the user selected
 * cells, he press the button to send and active actionPerformed() method of
 * class StartSharingAction<br/>
