/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story ipc01_01: start sharing.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
 * Allow connect to another instance of cleansheets and send a range of cells
 * for other instance. The received content should be presented in the same
 * "local". For this, in each instance cleansheets must be possible to define a
 * port for connections. It should be possible to find other cleansheets
 * instances on the same LAN. Instances should appear in a window and used to
 * make the connection. At this stage it is only necessary to transmit the
 * contents of the cells.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Start Sharing":</b>
 * The user selects the cells that he wants to share. Then begins the process of
 * connecting to another online user. The system displays a list of users to
 * which it can connect. The user selects customer that he wants to share cells
 * and the system sends the previously selected information.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * Since the connection between the users is necessary to study how the data
 * transmission protocols (TCP) and the search server protocol (UDP), and with
 * the definition of network and ports. On the other hand we must understand the
 * functioning of cells in order to submit their content to another user.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).<br/>
 * <br/>

 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Through the earlier draft we can see that was needed to create a new class.
 * This class will be responsible for the connection between users as well as
 * the transmission of the cells, so it is defined as a class of service.
 * <br/>
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * Since a connection port is needed, we need to add an attribute in the class
 * Conection in order to be able to change the port. Later you need a method
 * that takes the contents of the cells and another that sharing this data, so
 * that the information is shared between users. In addiction would be
 * interesting that this general class were generic, so that can be shared other
 * objects, as evolved in the project.
