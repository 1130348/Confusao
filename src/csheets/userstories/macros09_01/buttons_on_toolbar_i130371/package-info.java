/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story macros_09_01: buttons on
 * toolbar.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
 * Add a window that allows the user to add buttons (icons) on the toolbar of
 * cleansheets. Each button has associated a text that should appear when let
 * fluit the mouse above that icon (one tooltip). Should still has an action
 * when clinking. That action can be a macro, a beanshell script or a form. The
 * buttons on the toolbar can be active or not. If disable the click don't
 * originate any action. Should be added functions on macros and beanshell that
 * allows activate and disable the buttons on the toolbar.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Buttons on the toolbar":</b>
 * The user will need to click on the button "Add" or "Edit". After that it
 * should be possible to add a button and to choose the tooltip text and the
 * action that is associated. Then to activate the button that will be a
 * different window.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * The user will need to add a button that will appear on the toolbar. From this
 * moment, the ideia is to make an option on the menu with the name "add
 * button". When the user clicks on that option will open a new window that
 * allows the user to add a button. On the top of the window has the list of
 * action buttons already created. The user just need to insert the name of the
 * button (represented by a number), the tooltip, the icon and the
 * action.<br/><br/>
 * Let's see the ssd for the adding option. Like I said, the user select the
 * option on menu and the clicks on "Add Button". Then, will open a new window
 * in order to the user select the number, tooltip, the icon and the action that
 * is associated to that button.

 * <br/><br/>
 * To edit if the button is active or not I will need to create two function one
 * ACTIVATE_BUTTON and DEACTIVE_BUTTON passing by parameter the name of the
 * button. This is just an idea but it is the possibility how this will be
 * implemented. The main problem is the class that implements Function don't
 * have a method or the class UIController to get the components of the toolbar.
 * And because of that, I can't disable the button or activate. But this is a
 * problem that I want to resolve.<br/>
 * From this point, I just understand how it will be done because of the package
 * csheets.ext.style.ui that creats a toolbar and buttons. The main problem I
 * believe that is to know how the buttons will be save and the action ill be
 * atributed since I donÂ«t know what option the user will choose and on that
 * package has a class for each action. Because of that I think that is
 * necessary to create a controller that will create the actions to the button.
 * To make a class a toolbar will be necessary to implement JToolBar that has a
 * ButtonGroup with a vector of Abstract Vectors.
 * <br/>
 * Let's now see the class diagram from this use case with some of the methods
 * that the classes will have at this time of the analysis.
 * <br/><br/>
 * <img src = "doc-files/macros_09_01_analysis_classes.png"/>
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * <h2>3. Tests</h2>
 * Basically, from requirements and also analysis, we see that the MACRO
 * functionality of this use case is to be able to add buttons with some action
 * (macros, beansheel scripts or forms) to the toolbar. This use case is more
 * about GUI interface and because of that there are few tests to do. The class
 * ButtonsController is the only class where is necessary to do tests. I have 4
 * tests: two for know if the method verificationNames() is working (one with a
 * valid name and other without), other that tests if the method names() that
 * will add all the names of the icons to the ArrayList iconNames is working and
 * another is a get/set test of the variable iconNames that is an
 * ArrayList.<br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ButtonsControllerTest</code><br/>
 * Since almost all the methods in this use case were made previosly I assumed
 * that them unitary tests were working. On this use case, I created a lot of
 * new classes but all of them implemented or extends a class that was already
 * implemented in this cleansheets projet. All the classes that will be created:
 * to add the new buttons (the add and to edit - active or disable), the windows
 * that will open (Add: insert tooltip, the name of the icon and the chosen
 * action; Edit: edit a button or remove it). The controller class that will be
 * created (ButtonsController) will exist because of the differents action that
 * will be created. From this moment, I just can add an action of a macro to the
 * button because beanshell scripts and forms are not implemented yet. All the
 * methods of all the classes created I will test by functional tests and usind
 * debugging. As usual, in a test driven development approach tests normally
 * fail in the beginning. The idea is that the tests will pass in the end.
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>4. Design</h2>
 * When the cleansheets project open will be a button that allows the user to
 * create action buttons. When the user clicks on the button a new window will
 * be open and asks the user to fill all the information: the number of the
 * button (represents the name), the tooltip that wants to see when pass by the
 * button with the mouse and the action that is assigned. The action that is on
 * the button just can be a Macro because at this point scripts beanshell and
 * forms are not available and not implemented.<br/>
 * A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It
 * depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of
 * messages exchanged betwween the objets needed to carry out the functionality
 * of the scenario.<br/>
 * Let's now see the sequence diagram at this point of the documentation of this
 * use case.
 * <br/><br/>
 * <img src = "doc-files/macros_09_01_design_sequence.png"/>
 * <br/><br/>
 * The other part of this use case is to create functions on macros and
 * beansheel (at this point of the implementation just the macros exists so the
 * button just can have assigned a macro). The idea is to create two classes
 * that implements Function and when the user selects the function
 * ACTIVATE_BUTTON(name) the button with the chosen name stays active and if the
 * function is DEACTIVATE_BUTTON(name) the button will have the action
 * associated but nothing will be done when clicking.
 * <br/>
 * But there is a problem. When I create a class on the package
 * csheets.core.formula.lang and implements Function I can't have access to the
 * components of the toolbar. I just have the methods of the interface Function
 * and I cant have access to the method getComponents() that returns all the
 * components of the toolbar in order for the function able or disable the
 * button choosed by the user.
 *
 * <h2>5. Coding</h2>
 * It is important to refer that this use case is to macros, scripts beanshell
 * and to forms but beansheel and forms weren't implemented. This use case is
 * implemented just for Macros but it's simple to run with the scripts and
 * forms. It is just necessary to change small things. <br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ButtonsCell</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ButtonsExtension</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ButtonsSpreadsheet</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.AddAction</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.AddWindow</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.ButtonsAction</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.ButtonsController</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.ButtonsMenu</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.ButtonsToolBar</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.ButtonsUIExtension</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.toolbar_buttons.ui.DefaultAction</code><br/>
 * I create two functions that activate or deactivate a button. The user just
 * need to create the button first and then call the function passing the
 * name/number of the button. To do this, like it was said, were a few problems
 * because I hadn't access to the uiController to get the Extension and then the
 * Components of the toolbar in order to use the method setEnabled(true or
 * false) to the button that the user chose. The solution was to create a method
 * in the interface Function: setUIController() that allows that the classes
 * ActivateToolBarButton and DeactivateToolBarButton get access to it.<br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.core.formula.ActivateToolBarButton</code><br/>
 * see: <code>csheets.core.formula.DeactivateToolBarButton</code><br/>
 * To know the number of the button in order to activate or deactivate the user
 * can keep the mouse over the button and the tooltip will happen with the
 * number of the button and the tooltip text that the user choose. For example:
 * Number: 1, Tooltip Text: test and the finish tooltip will stay "1 -
 * Test".<br/>
 * Other thing that as important too on this coding part is that I had changed
 * the class MacrosWindowController and MacrosWindowDialog in order to keep
 * variables on the UIController. On the UIController I created two variables
 * and 4 methods (savedMacros, savedMacrosName -> gets e sets).<br/>
 *
 * <h2>6. Final Remarks</h2>
 * This use case is the first this sub-area "Buttons, Menus and Events". The
 * main problem I believe was the understanding of the code that was already
 * done about the macros implementation. Was the most difficult use case that I
 * implemented in LAPR4 because has a lot of thing to be done: The interface
 * about creating a button, add a button to the toolbar, add action to the
 * button and set the content to the active cell and create two function to
 * activate or disable some button of the toolbar.<br/><br/>
 * STEPS TO RUN THIS USE CASE: <br/>
 * 1 - Create a macro (Extensions -> Macros -> Create Macro) <br/>
 * 2 - Click on the green plus button and create an action button <br/>
 * 3 - Verifie if it's working selecting a cell and see that the action is the
 * new content <br/>
 * 4 - One option: To activate or deactivate the button: Functions -> Execute
 * Function -> ACTIVATE_BUTTON or DEACTIVATE_BUTTON with the number of the
 * button <br/>
