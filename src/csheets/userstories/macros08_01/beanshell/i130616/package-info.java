/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story macros 08_01: edition
 * beanshell window.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
 * Add an extension to allow write macros using Java BeanShell. You should see a
 * window that allows writing the script and run it. This option should be
 * integrated with other macros. A macro editing window should be the same. You
 * should you can select which language to write the macro: beanshell or
 * cleannsheets macros. to test the integration of beanshell this stage should
 * be possible to write on the macro editing window, a script beanshell that
 * opens a new workbook, create a macro (macros cleansheets), run this macro and
 * a window shows the result of this macro invocation.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * At this point, we already know how to use the cleansheets extension
 * mechanism. BeanShell is a library already done, so it will be necessary study
 * how the BeanShell interpreter works and how to use it. 
 * <br>
 * It will be necessary
 * study how to create macros (macros_06_01)  and how to opens a new workbook to do the use
 * case.
 * <br/>
 * <br>
 * <b>Execute BeanShell script</b>
