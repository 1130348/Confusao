 * Technical documentation regarding the user story core04_01: Navigation Window
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <b>Requirement</b><br/>
 * The use case requirements is to create an option to show the current
 * cleansheet.Will be created a extension to show this.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <b>Use Case "Navigation Window":</b> The user selects the extension on the
 * "Extension" tab where it creates a pop-up window where all the information is
 * shown.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * User Story Core04.1 is to show the information of the current
 * cleansheet.<br />
 * We must show all the information regarding the current cleansheets, and all
 * the cell comments.
 * <br/>
 *
 *
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <b>core04_01: Analysis Design</b><br/>
 * The following diagram shows how the process to get the information of
 * cleenshets.<br/><br/>
