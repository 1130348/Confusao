/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story macros04_01 : Conditional
 * Formatting Cells
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
 * Provide a new update on the extension "style" allowing the conditional
 * formatting of cells.
 *
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Use Case "Conditional Formatting Cells":</b> The user select "Conditional
 * Format"on the "Extensions" bar. The system show a item in the sidebar to
 * imput the condition of formating. After that the system will analyze the
 * cells and aply the format if "obeys" the condition. <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
 * User Story Macros04.1 aims to make it easier to differentiate cells that obey
 * to certain conditions  <br />
 * We have to go to the Cell and get their value compare with user imposed
 * conditions. Then, and depending on the result is true or false, the new
 * "Style" will be applied or not. <br/>
 * The research is carried out in the open Workbook and selected Spreadsheet.
 * <br/>
 *
 *
 * * <h2>3. Tests</h2>
 * To make easier the tests process we will make some funcional test where we
 * will verify if the conditional formating is working according to the guide
 *
 *
 *
 * <br/>
 * <h2>4. Design</h2>
 * To realize this use case we create rwo new mtehods, ConditionalFormatChoser
 * and conditionalFormatAction
 * <br/>
 * The following diagrams illustrate core aspects of the design of the solution
 * for this use case.<br/>
